# Reaction Game Layout

There are three main files to the Reaction Game Server.  The game main.script, the index.ts and the reactiongame.ts.  These files each have a specific purpose:

 - main.script - controls the game flow and communication with the reaction game room file (reactiongame.ts).

 - index.ts - sets up the server (on a particular port), and the game room (reactiongame.ts).

 - reactiongame.ts - controls the communication between the game client and the server.
